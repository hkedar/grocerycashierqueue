#Grocery Store Cashier Simulator

##General Rules of the Problem:
You are to write a program to implement a grocery store / cashier line simulation. This
program should read input from a file, and print the resulting score to the console. (The
program should be a console-only program.) The program should take a single command
line parameter, the name of the input file.
Customers in a grocery store arrive at a set of registers to check out. Each register is run
by a cashier who serves customers on a first-come, first-served basis. The goal of the
problem is to determine when all customers are done checking out.
One of the most important criteria for a successful solution is that it correctly implements
the problem to be solved. This will be determined by both code inspection and
acceptance testing using the 5 examples in this problem as well as additional test cases
not provided as part of the problem.
We will be considering your overall approach to the problem and your programming
style. This assignment is an opportunity to show off your domain modeling, OO, tests
and design skills to produce an elegant, readable and testable solution. Please do use what
you would consider best practice in developing your solution.
Deliverables (all of the following)
1) Source Code – The source code should preferably be in Java/.NET/Objective C.
2) If using Java, the jar file that results from the Source Code should run with JDK 1.7.
If using .NET the source should target .NET 3.5 or 4.0
3) Any other supporting code or other resources that you used to develop the
executable. (Even if it is not required to run or compile the executable.). If a
resource is easily accessible on the web you can just provide a link to it rather than
including the files.

##Problem Details:
1) The number of registers is specified by the problem inputs; registers are numbered
1, 2, 3, ..., n for n registers.
2) Time is measured in minutes.
3) The grocery store always has a single cashier in training. This cashier is always
assigned to the highest numbered register.
4) Regular registers take one minute to process each customer's item. The register
staffed by the cashier in training takes two minutes for each item. So a customer
with n items at a regular register takes n minutes to check out. However, if the
customer ends up at the last register, it will take 2n minutes to check out.
5) The simulation starts at t=0 . At that time all registers are empty (no customers in
line).
6) Two types of customers arrive at the registers:
a. Customer Type A always chooses the register with the shortest line (fewest
number of customers in line).
b. Customer Type B looks at the last customer in each line, and always chooses
to be behind the customer with the fewest number of items left to check out,
regardless of how many other customers are in the line or how many items
they have. Customer Type B will always choose an empty line before a line
with any customers in it.
7) Customers just finishing checking out do not count as being in line (for either kind
of Customer).
8) If two or more customers arrive at the same time, those with fewer items choose
registers before those with more, and if they have the same number of items then
type A's choose before type B's.
Input Format:
Input is in the form of a single integer (number of registers), followed by a list of pairs.
Each pair specifies the time in minutes (from a fixed offset) when a customer arrives to
the set of registers, and how many items that customer has. Each pair appears white-space
separated on a line by itself in the input file; see below for a sample input and output.

###Example #1
For the following input file:
1
A 1 2
A 2 1
The following highlights occur:
t=0 : Simulation starts with one register, which is a training register.
t=1 : Customer #1 (type A) arrives with 2 items and goes to register #1 which starts
servicing him.
t=2 : Customer #2 (type A) arrives with 1 item and goes to register #1, behind
Customer #1.
t=3 : (Customer #1 now has one item left, since the first item took two minutes).
t=5 : Customer #1 leaves and register #1 starts servicing Customer #2.
t=7 : Customer #2 leaves.
Here is the expected command output:
$ java -jar grocery.jar input.txt
Finished at: t=7 minutes
###Example #2
For the following input file:
2
A 1 5
B 2 1
A 3 5
B 5 3
A 8 2
The following highlights occur:
t=0 : Simulation starts with two registers; #2 is a training register.
t=1 : Customer #1 (type A) arrives with 5 items and goes to register #1 which starts
servicing him.
t=2 : Customer #2 (type B) arrives with 1 item and goes to register #2 which starts
servicing her.
t=3 : Customer #3 (type A) arrives with 5 items. Since he is type A, he goes to
register #1 (lowest number of two with equal number of customers), behind
Customer #1.
t=4 : Customer #2 leaves from register #2 (which took two minutes). (At this point,
register #1 has 7 items total: 2 for Customer #1 and all 5 for Customer #3.)
t=5 : Customer #4 (type B) arrives with 3 items. Since register #1 has customers
with 6 items, and register #2 is empty, she goes to register #2 which starts
servicing her.
t=6 : Customer #1 leaves and register #1 starts servicing Customer #3.
t=8 : Customer #5 (type A) arrives with 2 items. Since both registers have one
person, she goes to register #1 behind Customer #3.
t=11 : Customer #3 leaves and register #1 starts servicing Customer #5.
t=11 : Customer #4 leaves from register #2.
t=13 : Customer #5 leaves from register #1.
Here is the expected command output:
$ java -jar grocery.jar input.txt
Finished at: t=13 minutes
###Example #3
For the following input file:
2
A 1 2
A 1 2
A 2 1
A 3 2
Here is the expected command output:
$ java -jar grocery.jar input.txt
Finished at: t=6 minutes
(Note that this example illustrates the requirement that departing customers aren’t
counted in line).
###Example #4
For the following input file:
2
A 1 2
A 1 3
A 2 1
A 2 1
Here is the expected command output:
$ java -jar grocery.jar input.txt
Finished at: t=9 minutes
(Note that this example illustrates the requirement that customers with fewer items
choose lines sooner).
###Example #5
For the following input file:
2
A 1 3
A 1 5
A 3 1
B 4 1
A 4 1
Here is the expected command output:
$ java -jar grocery.jar input.txt
Finished at: t=11 minutes
(Note that this example illustrates the requirement that customers of type A choose before
customers of type B).
